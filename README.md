# Academic Demo

Hi! My name is Kamil and I'm currently studying Systems Engineering (Master's Degree) at WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology. In this repo I included some of the codes I made during the courses. My main programming language is Python, but I also know the basics of SQL, MATLAB and AMPL. I also worked with PowerBI and MS Excel (incl. Power Query and pivot tables).

> I am aware that most of the stuff you can see here is a strictly academic knowledge, but I'm sure it showcases some of my skills :)

| File/directory | Short overview |
| ------ | ------ |
| perceptron_final.py | A very simple model of perceptron, capable of learning given logical function with two variables (not all functions, because of mathematical limitations) with the use of unipolar or bipolar function |
| systems identification | Model fitting for given data, mostly using sklearn library and methods such as linear regression and naive Bayes |
| data warehouses | SQL codes (MS SQL Server 2017) and MS Excel sheets; I also did some PowerBI dashboards for this data, but I am unable to open them as I no longer have access to the database - I decided to include them anyway just to show that I actually worked with the program|
| decision support | Backend portion of the app supporting decision making (buying planes for the army), using AHP method and puLP solver; it doesn't use actual military data, of course |
| flowshop | A simple app for solving the flow shop scheduling problem, using NEH and simulated annealing. It was a basis for my BSc thesis. I also included some of the instances used for testing, which are reformatted files from Valada benchmark |
| stochastic models | Some of the models and visualizations I made during the course of the same name, including: Brownian Motion, fan charts, seasonal plots, Poisson Point Process, and Cellular Automata |
